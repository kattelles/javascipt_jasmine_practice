*READ ME*

Write your code in src/practice.js.

Specs are located in spec/practice_spec.js.

My solutions are in solutions/practice-solution.js. Obviously, these
are only my solutions and were not provided by a/a, so take them
with a grain of salt. There are probably many, better ways to solve all
of the problems while still passing the specs.

To run specs: open up SpecRunner.html in your browser.
